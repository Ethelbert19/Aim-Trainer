# 𝑨𝒊𝒎 𝑻𝒓𝒂𝒊𝒏𝒆𝒓 𝑮𝒂𝒎𝒆 — 𝑨 𝑭𝒖𝒏 𝑷𝒚𝒕𝒉𝒐𝒏 𝑴𝒐𝒖𝒔𝒆 𝑮𝒂𝒎𝒆!
Hey everyone!
 I just created a simple and fun game to help you practice your mouse aim.
Here’s how it works:
 Targets (small circles) show up on the screen, they grow bigger, then shrink away.
 Your job? Click on them before they disappear!
 You get only 3 chances, if you miss 3 times, the game ends.
 The faster and more accurate you are, the higher your score!
I made this game to learn how to build games with Python, and it turned out to be super fun and fast-paced — like those quick tap games we all love.
 ## What’s in the Game?
Targets appear, grow, and shrink — you must click fast!
3 lives — miss 3 times and it’s game over
Live score — shows your time, hits, speed, and lives left
Smooth and simple gameplay, just click and play!
💻 Built With
Python 3
Pygame (a tool to make games in Python)

Check out the screenshots below:
Screenshot 1: Targets in action, click fast!
Screenshot 2: Game over screen with your final stats.

Quick Note: You’ll need Python and Pygame installed to play locally, details in the README.

Give it a go and let me know your high score! Can you top mine?
